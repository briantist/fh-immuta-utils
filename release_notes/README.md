# How to Use

## In your PR
- Update `@vNext.md` with relevant changes being made (add to any other changes).
- See previous releases and/or `vNextTemplate.md` for inspiration/guidelines.

## In your Release PR
In addition to updating the version in the relevant places in code:
- Rename `@vNext.md` to `v##.##.##.md` to match the release version (ex. `v0.12.9.md`)
- Add a new blank `@vNext.md` file to be filled in with future changes.
